# NoSlack

This is a **Slack clone** / a team collaboration app that I built for my freelance web development team. This is just a demo version and **NOT** the actual app we're using. So, please feel free to leave anything on the demo app in the following link:

- Material-ui (UI design)
- Firebase (Google account authentification)
